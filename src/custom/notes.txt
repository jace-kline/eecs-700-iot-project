- Local MQTT (Mosquitto) broker is deployed
    - configured for either TLS or No TLS (unsecured)
- Local NoSQL DB is deployed
- Client publishes periodic messages to PUBLISH_TOPIC
- Receiver script listens to PUBLISH_TOPIC
- On reception of data, receiver stores data to DB
- After data stored successfully, receiver publishes to ACK_TOPIC
- Client records the RTT time
- Iterate
